# Telco Churn Prediction

**Objective:** Predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning to inform retention strategies.

**Dataset:** 7,043 customer records with 21 features including demographics, contract type, service usage, and tenure.

**Technical Stack:** Python | pandas | scikit-learn | matplotlib | seaborn | Jupyter Notebook | GitHub

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed and deployed a **Logistic Regression model** achieving:
  - **Accuracy:** 73.9%
  - **Precision:** 50.5%
  - **Recall:** 80.2%
  - **F1 Score:** 61.9%
  - **ROC-AUC:** 0.845
- Engineered high-impact features such as **tenure buckets, service counts, and contract type**, improving predictive power **15% over baseline models**.
- Visualized **churn risk by customer segment** using matplotlib/seaborn to identify high-risk groups and inform retention strategies.
- Documented **end-to-end workflow** in Jupyter Notebook with reproducible code and GitHub repository.

**Outcome:** Enabled data-driven insights to reduce churn and support strategic decision-making.
